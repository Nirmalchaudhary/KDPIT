                  The Highest Education is that which makes our life in harmony
                  with all existence. In the context, CHARUSAT as a University has been quite

                  between industry and academia; and community upliftment
                  through education. Importantly, CHARUSAT continually strives
                  to focus on the future with an entrepreneurial spirit.

                <p style={{ textAlign: "justify", lineHeight: "1.8rem" }}>
                  As a University, CHARUSAT is emerging with a thrust on
                  socially relevant Research & Development. For the purpose, a{' '}

                <p style={{ textAlign: "justify", lineHeight: "1.8rem" }}>
                  Efforts are also made for education amelioration in rural

                <p style={{ textAlign: "justify", lineHeight: "1.8rem" }}>
              Through these initiatives and practices, CHARUSAT focuses on
              converting eyes into sight and vision; information into knowledge
              and wisdom; and students / individuals into citizens and harmonious living.
              Further, programs at CHARUSAT enable the students not only to gain
              an understanding but also to develop insights in altered research
              areas. Teachers also dedicate their efforts to construct and
              facilitate opportunities where the{" "}
              <strong>students can practice and experience creativity.</strong>{" "}
              Moving a step ahead towards the purpose of education, CHARUSAT
              aims to make its students{" "}

            <p style={{ textAlign: "justify", lineHeight: "1.8rem" }}>
              In order to inculcate values in the students, CHARUSAT has been
              established as a University fostering{" "}
              <strong>High Moral Values.</strong> Honesty, Integrity, and
              Transparency have been the benchmarks of CHARUSAT in both – word
              and action.

              In the journey, CHARUSAT fosters a niche for a world-class

              I, earnestly, request you all to join hands with CHARUSAT and work
              towards the realization of this aspiration. Many have already
              volunteered in this <strong>Seva Yagna</strong> through their
              magnanimity, knowledge, skills and resource sharing; and through
              their association with CHARUSAT either as a Faculty, Staff or
              Student.
