                                    Convocation is a special event that marks
                                    the culmination of academic pursuits for
                                    students. At CHARUSAT, we organize our
                                    convocations with utmost piety and Indian
                                    tradition, making it a memorable experience
                                    for all. We take great pride in conferring
                                    degrees to our students in person, in a
                                    dignified manner, and awarding them with
                                    real gold medals and certificates, unlike
                                    the trend of gold plated medals. We also
                                    provide our students and their parents with
                                    special attention and hospitality during the

                                    of Indian culture, with the procession

                                    costumes and the convocation is inaugurated
                                    with a traditional Deep Pragatya ceremony.
                                    Notably, our convocation has been blessed by
                                    dignitaries who have made substantial

                                    We are organizing convocations at CHARUSAT,
