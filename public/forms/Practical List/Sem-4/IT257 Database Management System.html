                                            <br> A database needs to be developed for a letting agency in a big city.
                                            The agency rents out properties to tenants on behalf of the landlords.
                                            <br> 1. The company employs staff. Every member of staff has a unique staff
                                            ID. In addition, they have a name, a function (like secretary, accountant,
                                            etc.), and a monthly salary.
                                            <br> 2. In order to locate properties, the agency has split the city into
                                            different areas. Each area has a name, by which it can be uniquely
                                            identified. For each area, there is a member of staff who is responsible for
                                            the properties in the area.
                                            <br> 3. In order to locate properties, the agency has split the city into
                                            different areas. Each area has a name, by which it can be uniquely
                                            identified. For each area, there is a member of staff who is responsible for
                                            the properties in the area.
                                            <br> 4. Each property is of a specific type, for instance, a flat, a house,
                                            or a garage. The possible types are specified by the company. Each possible
                                            type needs to be recorded, also if there is no property of that type in the
                                            database.
                                            <br> 5. Each property is owned by a single landlord. A landlord, however,
                                            may own more than one property. A landlord is registered with name, address,
                                            and phone number. Each landlord can be uniquely identified by their name and
                                            address.
                                            <br> 6. A tenant is registered with a tenant ID, a current address, and a
                                            phone number.
                                            <br> 7. A tenant rents a property by signing a lease. The lease specifies
                                            the start date, i.e., the time when the contract begins, and the duration of
                                            the lease. A lease is always related to a specific property. For a given
                                            property, there cannot be two leases with the same start date.


                                            <br><br>
                                            <br> <b>Music Database:</b>
                                            <br> A database needs to be developed that keeps track of compact disks, and
                                            songs recorded on them, together with authors and performers of the songs.
                                            The data requirements are as follows:
                                            <br> 1. For each disk, we want to store the disk ID, the title, and the year
                                            of production. Disk ID’s are unique.
                                            <br> 2. A song is recorded on some disk. It has a title and a number that
                                            indicates on which track it is recorded on the disk. For each disk, a song
                                            is uniquely identified by its track number.
                                            <br> 3. For each person that may occur as an author or a performer we want
                                            to store the person ID, the name, and the nationality. Person ID’s are
                                            unique.
                                            <br> 4. Each song has at least one author who is a person. There are
                                            different types of authorship, e.g., composer, text writer, or arranger. For
                                            each author of a song, we want to store the type of authorship.
                                            <br> 5. Each song has at least one performer who is a person. There are
                                            different instruments for a performer, e.g., voice, piano, violin. We want
                                            to store for each performer the instrument they have played during the
                                            recording.

                                            <br> A publishing company produces scientific books on various subjects. The
                                            books are written by authors who specialize in one particular subject. The
                                            company employs editors who, not necessarily being specialists in a
                                            particular area, each take sole responsibility for editing one or more
                                            publications. A publication covers essentially one of the specialist
                                            subjects and is normally written by a single author. When writing a

                                            <br> A General Hospital consists of a number of specialized wards (such as
                                            Maternity, Pediatric, Oncology, etc.). Each ward hosts a number of patients,
                                            who were admitted on the recommendation of their own GP and confirmed by a

                                            A database is to be designed for a car rental company. The information
                                            required includes a description of cars, subcontractors (i.e., garages),
                                            company expenditures, company revenues and customers. Cars are to be
                                            described by such data as: make, model, year of production, engine size,
                                            fuel type, number of passengers, registration number, purchase price,
                                            purchase date, rent price and insurance details. It is the company policy
                                            not to keep any car for a period exceeding one year. All major repairs and
                                            maintenance are done by subcontractors (i.e., franchised garages), with whom
                                            CRC has long-term agreements. Therefore, the data about garages to be kept
                                            in the database includes garage names, addresses, range of services and the
                                            like. Some garages require payments immediately after a repair has been
                                            made; with others CRC has made arrangements for credit facilities. Company
                                            expenditures are to be registered for all outgoings connected with
                                            purchases, repairs, maintenance, insurance etc. Similarly, the cash inflow
                                            coming from all sources: Car hire, car sales, insurance claims must be kept
                                            of file. CRC maintains a reasonably stable client base. For this privileged
                                            category of customers special credit card facilities are provided. These
                                            customers may also book in advance a particular car. These reservations can
                                            be made for any period of time up to one month. Casual customers must pay a
                                            deposit for an estimated time of rental, unless they wish to pay by credit

                                            4. <b>STUDENT PROGRESS MONITORING SYSTEM</b><br>
                                            A database is to be designed for a college to monitor students' progress
                                            throughout their course of study. The students are reading for a degree
                                            (such as BA, BA (Hons) M.Sc., etc.) within the framework of the modular
                                            system. The college provides a number of modules, each being characterized
                                            by its code, title, credit value, module leader, teaching staff and the
                                            department they come from. A module is coordinated by a module leader who
                                            shares teaching duties with one or more lecturers. A lecturer may teach (and
                                            be a module leader for) more than one module. Students are free to choose
                                            any module they wish but the following rules must be observed: Some modules
                                            require pre- requisites modules and some degree programmes have compulsory
                                            modules. The database is also to contain some information about students
                                            including their numbers, names, addresses, degrees they read for, and their
                                            past performance i.e., modules taken and examination results. For the above
                                            case study, do the following:<br>
                                            7. Analyze the data required.<br>
                                            8. Normalize the attributes. <br>
                                            9. Create the logical data model using ER diagrams. <br>
                                            10. Comprehend the data given in the case study by creating respective
                                            tables with primary keys and foreign keys wherever required.<br>
                                            11. Insert values into the tables created (Be vigilant about Master- Slave
                                            tables). <br>
                                            12. Display the Students who have taken B. Tech (IT) course. <br>
